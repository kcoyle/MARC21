# What Developers and Library Technologists Like About MARC

## Records and Files Are Compact

It is not uncommon to exchange or process files with millions of records. These files can be transferred over the network fairly quickly and can be stored on a desktop computer. This is important because libraries receive files of records from other libraries or from vendors, and it must be possible to process them in house.

## Tools Exist

There are tools that process the MARC record that can be used without having to do programmiing. The primary one is Terry Reese's MARCedit. These tools are used for various functions, including:

* statistical analysis of a file of records; this can be a general overview of the file or a specific inquiry about quality such as which records are missing a particular field
* batch updates; batch updates can be used to include particular information, such as the library name and ownership information, or to correct known problems, like records that have retained an obsoleted value.

## Library Systems Know MARC

MARC is the common input and output format for nearly all major library systems in use. Because libraries will not have the capacity (nor would it be efficient) to create their systems in-house, vendor support is essential.
