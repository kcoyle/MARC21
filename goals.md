# Basic goals for a metadata format

## Physical format

* 
* No limits on record or field size
* Support part/whole relationships
* Fully extensible; can add new elements as needed
* Support linking between entities (e.g. FRBR work/work relationships)
* Enable Unicode everywhere
* Support versioning
* Format definition is in a standard machine-actionable encoding

## Metadata definitions

* Each data point (piece of information) exists only once in each description
* All entity descriptions are coded identically wherever they appear
* Lists of values maintained outside the format standard
* Support internationalization of input and output displays
* Feasible integration of local elements and values
* Coding fully defines data elements, not order
* No ambiguous ("X or Y") elements
* Display is data-driven where possible
