# Basic goals for a metadata format

* Each data point (piece of information) exists only once in each description
* All entity descriptions are coded identically wherever they appear
* Extensible; can add new elements as needed
* No limits on record or field size
* Lists of values maintained outside the format standard
* Fully support Unicode
* Support internationalization of input and output displays
* Feasible integration of local elements and values
* Support part/whole relationships
* Coding fully defines data elements, not order
* No ambiguous ("X or Y") elements
* Display is data-driven where possible
* Linking between records for relationships (e.g. X is adaptation of Y)
* Data description is in a standard machine-actionable coding
