# What Catalogers Like/Love About MARC

There is resistance to move away from MARC for cataloging among some in the cataloging community. For these librarians, MARC has many positive qualities. 

## MARC is Familiar

Library cataloging makes use of a very complex set of rules that determine how a resource is described. Once the decisions are made regarding the content of the description, those results are coded in MARC. Because the creation of the catalog record has been done in the MARC format since the late 1970's, working catalogers today have only known MARC as the cataloging interface. Catalogers speak in "MARC" - using the tags to name data elements - e.g. "245" instead of "title proper".
