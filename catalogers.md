# What Catalogers Like/Love About MARC

There is resistance to move away from MARC for cataloging among some in the cataloging community. For these librarians, MARC has many positive qualities. 

## MARC is Familiar

Library cataloging makes use of a very complex set of rules that determine how a resource is described. Once the decisions are made regarding the content of the description, those results are coded in MARC. Because the creation of the catalog record has been done in the MARC format since the late 1970's, working catalogers today have only known MARC as the cataloging interface. Catalogers speak in "MARC" - using the tags to name data elements - e.g. "245" instead of "title proper". 

## MARC is WYSIWYG

Those who work with MARC consider it to be "human readable." Most of the description is text, therefore what the cataloger creates is exactly what will appear on the screen in the library catalog. If a cataloger types "ill." that is what will display; if the cataloger instead types "illustrations" then that is what will display. 

## Control

The coding is visible, and therefore what the cataloger creates on the screen is virtually identical to the machine-readable record that is being created. 

## MARC is International

MARC is used internationally, and because the record uses numerics and alphanumeric codes, a record created in another country is readable to other MARC users. Note that this was also the purpose of the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), which instead of tags uses punctuation marks to delimit elements of the bibliographic description. If a cataloger sees this, but cannot read the text:
      245 02   |a לטוס עם עין אחת / |c דני בז.
      
it is still clear that this is a title field with a main title (no subtitle), followed by a statement of the author's name as provided on the title page of the book.
