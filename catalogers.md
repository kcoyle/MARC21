# What Catalogers Like/Love About MARC

There is resistance to moving away from using the MARC record for cataloging among some in the Anglo-American cataloging community. That community has been creating cataloging data in the MARC formats for forty years. For these librarians, MARC has many positive qualities, and these are qualities that are not perceived to exist in the proposals for linked data. (Throughout the sections below, read "library cataloging" and variants as referring to the Anglo-American cataloging tradition that uses the MARC format and the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules and its newer forms.)

## MARC is Familiar

Library cataloging makes use of a very complex set of rules that determine how a resource is described. Once the decisions are made regarding the content of the description, those results are coded in MARC. Because the creation of the catalog record has been done in the MARC format since the late 1970's, working catalogers today have known only MARC as the bibliographic record format and the cataloging interface. Catalogers speak in "MARC" - using the tags to name data elements - e.g. "245" instead of "title proper". 

## MARC is WYSIWYG

Those who work with MARC consider it to be "human readable." Most of the description is text, therefore what the cataloger creates is exactly what will appear on the screen in the library catalog. If a cataloger types "ill." that is what will display; if the cataloger instead types "illustrations" then that is what will display. In terms of viewing a MARC record on a screen, some cataloger displays show the tags and codes to one side, and the text of those elements is clearly readable as text. 

## MARC Gives Catalogers Control

The coding is visible, and therefore what the cataloger creates on the screen is virtually identical to the machine-readable record that is being created. Everything that will be shown in the catalog is in the record (with the exception of cover art, at least in some catalogs). The MARC rules say that the order of fields and subfields in the record are the order in which that information should be displayed in the catalog. Some systems violate this by putting the fields in numeric order, but the order of subfields is generally maintained. Catalogers wish to control the order of display and are frustrated when they cannot. In general, changing anything about the record with automated procedures can un-do the decisions made by catalogers as part of their work, and is a cause of frustration for catalogers. 

## MARC is International

MARC is used internationally, and because the record uses numerics and alphanumeric codes, a record created in another country is readable to other MARC users. Note that this was also the purpose of the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), which instead of tags uses punctuation marks to delimit elements of the bibliographic description. If a cataloger sees this, but cannot read the text:

      245 02   |a לטוס עם עין אחת / |c דני בז.
      
it is still clear that this is a title field with a main title (no subtitle), followed by a statement of the author's name as provided on the title page of the book.

## MARC is the Lingua Franca of Cataloging

This is probably the key point that comprises all of the above, but it is important to state it as such. This means that the entire workflow, the training materials, the documentation - all use MARC. Catalogers today think in MARC and communicate in MARC. This also means that MARC defines the library cataloging community in the way that a dialect defines the local residents of a region. There is pride in its "library-ness". It is also seen as expressing the Anglo-American cataloging tradition.

## MARC is Concise

MARC is concise as a physical format (something that is less important today than it was in the 1960s when MARC was developed), and it is also concise on the screen. "245" represents "title proper"; "240" represents "uniform title"; "130" represents "uniform title main entry". Often an entire record can be viewed on a single screen, and the tags and subfield codes take up very little display space.

# MARC is Very Detailed

MARC21 has about 200 tags currently defined, and each of these can have up to 36 subfields. There are about 2000 subfields defined in MARC21, although the distribution is uneven and depends on the semantics of the field; some fields have only a handful of subfields, and in others there are few codes remaining that could be assigned. 

# MARC is Flat

The MARC record is fairly flat, with only two levels of coding: field and subfield. This is a simple model that is easy to understand and easy to visualize. 

# MARC is Extensible

Throughout its history, the MARC record has been extended by adding new fields and subfields. There are about 200 defined fields which means that there is room to add approximately 600 more. 

# MARC has Mnemonics

Some coding is either consistent or mnemonic, which makes it easier for catalogers to remember the meaning of the codes. There are code blocks that refer to cataloging categories, such as the title block (2XX), the notes block (5XX) and the subject block (6XX). Some subfields have been reserved through for particular functions, such as the use of the numeric subfields in 0-8. In other cases, the mnemonic is used in certain contexts, such as the use of subfield "v" for the volume information of series. In other fields, the "v" may be used for something else, such as the "form" subfield in subject fields, but the context makes it clear.

There are also field mnemonics. For example, all tagged fields that have "00" in the second and third places are personal name fields. All fields and subfields that use the number 9 are locally defined (with a few well-known exceptions).
