MARC21 is not Z39.2 (or ISO2709)

The MARC21 record is a single implementation of the actual MARC (general) standard. That latter is defined as Z39.2 in NISO and ISO2709 in ISO. The standard that is behind the MARC21 record format has capabilities that were not implemented in the Library of Congress or other library versions of MARC, once called "US MARC" and now called "MARC21". 

| datum | ISO2709 (Z39.2) | MARC21 |
